# DVDVision 
An upgraded Pong game where the players are able to reminisce on the past. This project is an interactive WebGL game inspired by the classic bouncing DVD logo combined with Pong-style paddle gameplay and strategic obstacle placement. Two players compete by controlling paddles while also placing obstacles that can bounce the DVD ball. Power-ups, scoring, textured graphics, ghost cursors, and adjustable gameplay settings make the experience dynamic and engaging.
